# SearchedTree
SearchedTree is a tool for creating static dropdown tree lists with search. This tool was created to simplify the creation of other tools that require static dropdown trees with search for the editor

### Features
- Simple creation of static searchable tree lists for the editor window.
- Simple integration into any Unity Editor tool.

### Attention!
This tool is initially intended for use in the ImGUI shell from [Enigmatic.Core](), but it is also possible to implement opening the search window for both the regular ImGUI and the UI Toolkit. Implementation details will be given at the end of the documentation.
