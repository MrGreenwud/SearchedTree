# SearchedTree
SearchedTree is a tool for creating static dropdown tree lists with search. This tool was created to simplify the creation of other tools that require static dropdown trees with search for the editor

### Features
- Simple creation of static searchable tree lists for the editor window.
- Simple integration into any Unity Editor tool.

### Attention!
This tool is initially intended for use in the ImGUI shell from [Enigmatic.Core](https://github.com/MrGreenwud/Enigmatic.Core), but it is also possible to implement opening the search window for both the regular ImGUI and the UI Toolkit. Implementation details will be given at the end of the documentation.

### Installation
1. Download and Install the [Enigmatic.Core](https://github.com/MrGreenwud/Enigmatic.Core) package from [release](https://github.com/MrGreenwud/Enigmatic.Core/releases) into your project.
2. Download and Install [ENIX](https://github.com/MrGreenwud/ENIX) library from [release](https://github.com/MrGreenwud/ENIX/releases) into your project.
3. Download and install SearchedTree itself from [release](https://github.com/MrGreenwud/SearchedTree/releases) into your project.

# How to use?
## Create tree
1. First thing you need to do is create a static search tree. 
Search trees are created in a separate editor window, which can be opened via the toolbar.

2. The window that opens displays three columns and a toolbar.
   - The first column is groups of trees.
   - The second column is search trees.
   - The third column is the settings of the selected elements.

There are three buttons on the toolbar:
 - Save - saves all groups to a folder along the path Resources/Enigmatic/Editor/SearchedTree/GroupName/TreeRoot.stp, where:
   - GroupName — автоматически создаваемая папка с именем группы.
   - TreeRoot.stp — файл формата .stp, содержащий данные дерева и название его корневого элемента.
 - Load - opens a window for selecting a file with the .stp extension. Once a file is selected, the tree is loaded and, if necessary, a corresponding group is created for that tree.

You can also load a .stp file using the 'drag and drop' function by dragging one or more .stp files into the SearchedTree editor window.
 - Generate - allows you to generate tree elements based on an Enum, which speeds up the process of converting Enum elements into a tree. This is especially useful when working with large amounts of data. We'll talk about this in more detail a little later.

3. To create a tree, follow these steps:
    1. Click on the "+" button in the 'Group' column to create a group of trees.
    2. Select the group and rename it in the 'Settings' column.
    3. Go to the 'TreeView' column and click on the "+" button to create the root element of the tree.
    4. Once you select an element, you can rename it in the 'Settings' window, and add or remove child elements.

4. You can also generate tree elements from Enum. To do this, click on the Generate button on the toolbar, after which a window with settings will open.
    - Path Type - determines where the tree elements will appear:
      - Selection Group - elements will be added as roots in the selected group.
      - Selection Branch - Elements will be added as children of the selected tree element.
    - Enum name - specify the name of the Enum whose elements you want to convert into tree elements.

Click Generate to complete the process of converting Enum elements into tree elements.
